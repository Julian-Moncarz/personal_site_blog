<title> Start teensy only </title>

<p>Never start big. Start teensy.<br>
All my big plans - waking up at 7:00 to study mech interp for 2h every day, stretching every day for 40 mins etc. They don't happen. I don't do them, because I make them all or nothing. The all is too big, so when other things pop up, I do nothing.</p>

<p>Start teensy.</p>

<p>Take the big, ambitious thing and then recite: "I start teensy". Figure out the smallest way you can take action on it. Do that. Build up. Or don't. Start teensy. Start big = don't start.</p>

<p>Due to diminishing returns - the first bit is disproportionately valuable and you will get a huge boost from it!</p>

<p>Examples:</p>

<p>If you want to start stretching - start teensy! 1 min stretching each day<br>
If you want to start mech interp, start with just 5 mins per day reading about a technique and understanding it</p>

<p>If you want to start a blog, start by posting 1 thing in 1 place - set a 1h timer and post somewhere by the end of it. Or even better, post something you wrote already.</p>

<p>If you want to get a job in a field, do a small thing (look at a few profs in the feild for 5 mins - make a list of emails) there first. </p>

<h3>Starting teensy only</h3>

<p>Another helpful thing can be to ban yourself from doing more than the teensy amount. This is motivational - if someone tells you you cannot eat cookies, you often want to <em>eat them</em>. If you can only do a certain teensy amount of a new thing, that makes it a fun and precious commodity, which you will savour.</p>

<p>It also helps with not overcommitting your time and having slack. Often, I will start a new project, which I enjoy (creating this site, for example), and instantly overcommit to it, at the expense of other things (homework, for example). Starting teensy only solves one problem: making new things into overly large commitments. That problem has two faces:</p>

<ul>
<li>not doing the thing ever because it is too big and scary to start</li>
<li>starting the thing, overcommitting to it and having it negatively affect other things</li>
</ul>

<p>This is a rephrasing of a common piece of advice: "start small". The specific framing of "start teensy only" feels better for me.</p>

<p>This site / post existing is a result of starting teensy! I had wanted to start a blog for a long time, but it was always too big a thing. Start teensy only. I sat down for 1 h and made it and posted.</p>
